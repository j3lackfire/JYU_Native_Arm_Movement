# JYU_Native_Arm_Movement
Please go to local/master branch, that is the main branch, this one doesn't work for some reasons.

This app helps detect stroke using arm movement. When the user feels like they might have a stroke, they may use the app to test if they really have it (or not). If they do, the app can call the emergency number to help the patient.

The app at this current state is not intended for real world usage but rather a demo and an experiment of what works and what not. Saying that, the algorithm and the functionalities are all tested and appear to work correctly, the only thing that lacking now is a good GUI (Graphical user interface) for the user.


Full reports with pictures and everything.
